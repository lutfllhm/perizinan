Fixed Hostinger deployment compatibility

- Added composer.json for framework detection
- Added index.php as main entry point
- Added .htaccess for Apache routing
- Added backend/server.php as PHP wrapper for Node.js
- Added hostinger-deploy.json for deployment config
- Added validation script (validate-hostinger.js)
- Added deployment documentation (DEPLOY-HOSTINGER.txt)
- Added quick start guide (QUICK-START-HOSTINGER.txt)
- Added .gitattributes for line endings consistency
- Added .hostingerignore for deployment optimization
- Updated README.md with Hostinger instructions
- Updated package.json with hostinger:* scripts

This fixes the "Framework tidak kompatibel" error when importing
repository to Hostinger Git.

Ready for deployment via Hostinger Git Import.
